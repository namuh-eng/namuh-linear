# Build Spec — Linear Clone (namuh-linear)

> **Status**: COMPLETE — all pages inspected, ready for build phase

## Product Overview

Linear is a keyboard-first issue tracking and project management tool for software teams. It emphasizes speed, clean design, and opinionated workflows.

**Core features (must build first):**
1. **Issues** — The atomic unit. Workflow states, priority, estimates, labels, assignees, due dates, relations.
2. **Teams** — Organizational unit with namespaced identifiers (ENG-123) and custom workflows.
3. **Command Palette (Cmd+K)** — Search, navigate, create — all from keyboard.
4. **Projects** — Time-bound deliverables grouping issues across teams, with milestones and progress tracking.
5. **Triage** — Intake queue for incoming issues.

**Secondary features:**
- Cycles (automated sprints), Initiatives (strategic goals), Custom Views, Inbox/Notifications, My Issues, Display Options, Filters

**Key differentiators:** Command palette, keyboard shortcuts everywhere, real-time sync, clean minimal dark-mode-first UI.

## Authentication (P1)

### Methods
1. **Google OAuth** — Better Auth Google provider
2. **Email Magic Links** — Better Auth email + SES, 6-digit code + clickable link
3. No passwords — fully passwordless

### Flow
- Login page: "Continue with Google" + "Continue with Email"
- New users → workspace creation → default team auto-created
- Existing users → redirect to last workspace
- Sessions in Postgres via Better Auth Drizzle adapter
- Protected routes via Next.js middleware

## Onboarding (P2-P3)

1. Sign up (Google or magic link)
2. Create workspace (name + URL slug) — auto-creates default team
3. Invite team members (skippable)
4. Land on dashboard with empty states
