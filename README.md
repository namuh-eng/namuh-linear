## About

namuh-linear is a production-grade issue tracking and project management tool built to match Linear's speed and keyboard-first UX. Whether you're a startup building in public or an enterprise needing self-hosted infrastructure, namuh-linear is a fully open source alternative that you can deploy, customize, and extend.

Built by [ralph-to-ralph](https://github.com/namuh-eng/ralph-to-ralph), an autonomous product cloning system, namuh-linear represents 41 features across issues, projects, cycles, initiatives, and real-time notifications — all tested and deployed from day one.

## Features

Core capabilities:

- **Issues** — Create, assign, prioritize, estimate, label, and organize with workflow states (Backlog, In Progress, Done, Canceled)
- **Projects** — Time-bound deliverables with milestones, progress tracking, and status updates
- **Cycles** — Automated sprints with burndown charts and auto-rollover
- **Initiatives** — Strategic roadmap grouping multiple projects
- **Custom Views** — Filter-based board, list, and timeline layouts
- **Triage Queue** — Intake system for incoming issues with bulk actions
- **Inbox & Notifications** — Real-time updates for assignments, mentions, and status changes

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/namuh-eng/namuh-linear.git
cd namuh-linear

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start infrastructure services (PostgreSQL + Redis)
make dev-services

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS credentials and auth settings

# Run database migrations
npm run db:push

# Start the dev server (runs on http://localhost:3015)
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose (Coming Soon)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namuh-eng/namuh-linear.git
cd namuh-linear

docker compose up
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3015`.

## Development

### Commands

```bash
# Type check and lint
make check

# Run unit tests
make test

# Run E2E tests (requires dev server running)
make test-e2e

# Run all checks
make all

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Push database schema changes
npm run db:push
```

### Quality Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any` types
- **100% tested** — every feature has unit tests (Vitest) and E2E tests (Playwright)
- **Consistent formatting** — Biome handles linting and formatting
- **Small commits** — one feature per commit with clear messages

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** — [install](https://nodejs.org/)
- **PostgreSQL 15+** — local or AWS RDS
- **Redis 7+** — local or AWS ElastiCache
- **AWS Account** (optional) — for S3, SES, RDS, ElastiCache

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/namuh_linear

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# AWS (optional, required for production)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key

# S3 (for file uploads)
AWS_S3_BUCKET=namuh-linear-uploads

# SES (for email)
AWS_SES_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@namuh-linear.app

# Authentication
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your-google-oauth-id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-google-oauth-secret
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret
```

### Infrastructure Provisioning (Production)

To provision AWS infrastructure (RDS, ElastiCache, S3, ECR, SES):

```bash
bash scripts/preflight.sh
```

This script will:
- Create RDS PostgreSQL instance
- Create ElastiCache Redis cluster
- Create S3 bucket for uploads
- Configure SES for email delivery
- Create ECR registry for Docker images

## Built by AI

namuh-linear was built autonomously by **[ralph-to-ralph](https://github.com/namuh-eng/ralph-to-ralph)**, a multi-agent system that clones SaaS products end-to-end.

The system:
1. **Inspects** the target product (Linear) using Claude + Ever CLI
2. **Builds** a working clone with TDD — 41 features, 24,000+ lines of code
3. **Tests** every feature with Vitest + Playwright
4. **Deploys** to AWS with real infrastructure

The entire process runs fully autonomous with zero human intervention. This README and documentation are human-written to ensure clarity and accuracy.
